pyenv
=====

pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

**NOTE** This project is currently not installable with pip.

You should use the `pyenv-installer` script::

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

See `project home <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer>`_ for more information.
